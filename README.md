 **DAY 6,7:**
By the end of #week1ofmlcode in 100 days of ml coding challenge,  I thought of taking up a course on Coursera -"Introduction to Data Science in Python" which would help me to emulate the best and I successfully completed the course which helped me in understanding data manipulation and cleaning techniques using the popular python pandas data science library.

**DAY 12**:
understood the following concepts:
fixing missingdata using 'Imputer', categorical data using 'LabelEncoder' and dummy Encoding using 'OneHotEncoder' and finally splitting dataset into 'testset' and 'trainset' using train_test_split from sklearn libraries.


**DAY 13:**
gone through a few research papers which helped in understanding the real world applications of machine learning.

**DAY 17:**
TOPIC: Probability
UNDERSTANDING: In machine learning, the concept of probability plays an important role. For example, we ask our machine learning algorithm how likely our result is. Thus, after knowing the importance I started a playlist of Prof. Joe Biltzstein from Harvard University.
