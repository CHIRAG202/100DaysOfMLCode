 **DAY 6,7:**
By the end of #week1ofmlcode in 100 days of ml coding challenge,  I thought of taking up a course on Coursera -"Introduction to Data Science in Python" which would help me to emulate the best and I successfully completed the course which helped me in understanding data manipulation and cleaning techniques using the popular python pandas data science library.
