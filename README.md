DAY 0:
To implement linear regression with one
variable to predict profits for a food truck. Suppose that I am the CEO of a
restaurant franchise and are considering different cities for opening a new
outlet. The chain already has trucks in various cities and you have data for
profits and populations from the cities.
I would like to use this data to help select which city to expand
to next.
The file 1.txt contains the dataset for our linear regression prob-
lem.
